# Existing issues
Since the project has only been started for three days, and I have just started working with Android for a week, my coding ability is limited, and UI improvement, style unification, etc., as well as code structure refactoring are needed in the later stage. Therefore, it takes a certain amount of time. At present, the overall style and aesthetics are poor, and it will take time to optimize in the later stage, and some functions have not yet been realized. You can also contact me if you have a good opinion.

# Developing
